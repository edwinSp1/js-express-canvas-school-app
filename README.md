# How to run:

ALL CANVAS KEYS ARE ENCRYPTED!
Encryption key and database access keys are hidden from view. You will have to create your own database deployment. 

Install Node.js, and run npm install AFTER you have downloaded and unzipped the file. This will install all the dependencies. 
Optionally, you can delete anything under .gitignore.

Windows: npx nodemon run OR node bin/www

Mac: nodemon run OR node bin/www
